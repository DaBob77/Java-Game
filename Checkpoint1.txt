In two weeks:
    We will have very basic assets
    We will have basic movement working
    Have portals working
    Have interactable* boxes (We plan to be able to grab boxes and move them with our cursor, so this might not be completely finished yet)
    Be working on actual puzzles (this includes buttons and boxes)

Struggles:
    Mostly just syntax for swing graphics

Team Concerns:
    None
